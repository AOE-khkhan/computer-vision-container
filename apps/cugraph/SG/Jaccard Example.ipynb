    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Jaccard similarity between two sets is defined as the ratio of the volume of their intersection divided by the volume of their union. In the context of graphs, the volum of a vertex refers to the neighborhood of that vertex.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The neighbors of a vertex, v, is defined as the set, U, of vertices connected by way of an edge to vertex v, or N(v) = {U} where v ∈V and ∀ u∈U ∃ edge(v,u)∈E.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jaccard can be defined as<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$Jaccard(i, j) = \\frac{|(N(i)  \\cap  N(j)))|}{|(N(i)  \\cup  N(j))|}$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jaccard similarity weight of each edge represents the strength of connection between vertices based on the relative similarity of their neighbors. For further detail see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the Jaccard similarity between all-pairs of vertices connected by an edge in cuGraph use: \n",
    "**nvJaccard(G)**\n",
    "* __G__: A cugraph.Graph object\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns:\n",
    "* __df__: cudf.DataFrame with three names columns:\n",
    "    * df[\"source\"]: The source vertex id.\n",
    "    * df[\"destination\"]: The destination vertex id.\n",
    "    * df[\"jaccard_coeff\"]: The jaccard coefficient computed between the source and destination vertex.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## cuGraph 0.6 Notice \n",
    "cuGraph version 0.6 has some limitations:\n",
    "* Only Int32 Vertex ID are supported\n",
    "* Only float (FP32) edge data is supported\n",
    "* Vertex numbering is assumed to start at zero\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations are being addressed and will be fixed future versions.  \n",
    "These example notebooks will illustrate how to manipulate the data so that it comforms to the current limitations    \n",
